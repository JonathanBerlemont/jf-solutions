    <p>I am specialized in <span>R&D and Innovation</span>, in fields like <br>
        Mechanics - Electromechanics - Mechatronics - Hydraulics - Pneumatics.</p>

    <p>I will make you benefit from a significant experience in the aerospace and automotive industry, via
        key roles in projects like the Ariane 5 – Vulcain cryogenic valves (at Techspace Aero / Safran
        Aerobooster), or depollution systems and fuel injection systems for various car manufacturer (at
        Delphi). Beside the generic development engineering skills, I acquired specific competences in
        technologies like piezo electric actuators, or closed loop injection control systems.</p>

    <p><span>Innovation</span> is in my DNA. I’m inventor on numerous patents.</p>

    <p>I will deliver creative and efficient <span>Solutions</span></p>

    <p>Starting from a white page, or from an existing product, we will bring the ideas and innovative
        <span><strong>solutions</strong></span> you need for an efficient and succesfull project
        ...<br>Our
        fields of expertise are
        <span><strong>mechanics, hydraulics, pneumatics, electromechanics and
                mechatronics</strong></span>,
        with missions ranging
        from
        optimisation, problem solving ... to full product design.
    </p>',

    'service_simulation' => '<h2 class=" text-center">Simulation</h2>
    <p>The cheapest test is the test you do not have to do ! Via an accurate modelling of your product
        physical behaviour,
        you will be able to evaluate its performance virtually, and investigate various effects, like
        tolerances, environmental conditions ...
        This is the <span><strong>solution</strong></span> you need for an efficient product
        development and optimisation.
    </p>',

    'service_test' => '<h2 class=" text-center">Test</h2>
    <p>Testing remains one of the key task in product development, and especially, validation. We can
        bring you <span><strong>solutions</strong></span> in designing not only the required tests
        themselves, but also define/design the test equipment,
        the test plans, and all the required
        tools for test automation when necessary. And last but not least, we can support you in the
        test data analysis and conclusions.

    'service_software' => '<h2 class=" text-center">Software</h2>
    <p>Today, almost all tasks of a development engineer is aided by computers in one way or the other.
    From a simple macro to optimize an excel worksheet, to a fully dedicated and specific
    application development, we will bring <span><strong>solutions</strong></span> based on a solid
    experience with various
    languages
    like VB, VBA, Python, C, C++ and also LabView.
