                <p>I have a Master in Electromechanical - Aerospace engineering, from the University of Liège.</p>

                <p>I am specialized in <span>R&D and Innovation</span>, in fields like <br>
                    Mechanics - Electromechanics - Mechatronics - Hydraulics - Pneumatics.</p>

                <p>I will make you benefit from a significant experience in the aerospace and automotive industry, via
                    key roles in projects like the Ariane 5 – Vulcain cryogenic valves (at Techspace Aero / Safran
                    Aerobooster), or depollution systems and fuel injection systems for various car manufacturer (at
                    Delphi). Beside the generic development engineering skills, I acquired specific competences in
                    technologies like piezo electric actuators, or closed loop injection control systems.</p>

                <p><span>Innovation</span> is in my DNA. I’m inventor on numerous patents and I received the Delphi
                    Innovation Hall of Fame award.</p>

                <p>I will deliver creative and efficient <span>Solutions</span></p>
